DIFF TYPES OF GREPS
---------------------
1.grep, egrep (Extended GREP), fgrep (Fixed GREP), pgrep (Process GREP), rgrep (Recursive GREP) etc

MAINLY IN THE MARKET THREE GREPS.
1.GREP
2.EGREP
3.FGREP


EGREP
---------
Egrep supports more regular expression patterns

1.egrep p{2} *


fgrep
-------
fgrep is a faster version of grep which does not support regular expressions and therefore is 
considered to be faster.

fgrep is equal to grep -F
