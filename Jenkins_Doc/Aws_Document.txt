===============

Concepts:
----------
1)Amazon Ec2   

2)Storage Services and Aws cli 

3)Vpc & Direct Connect

4)Database Services => 

5)Elb and Auto scaling 

6)Route 53 & Management Tools

7)Application Services Lambda & Beanstalk

8)OpsWorks security & Identity Services 

9)Mock Test & Doubt Cleaning Session 

========================================================

1) EC2:

=> it's a shared pool of configurable computing resources exm:Networks, Servers, Storage, Applications, and Services 

*** How to launch the servers 

=> First we go to aws dashboard

=> Choose AMI which server you need to get like windows or linux or Ubuntu 

=> Choose an instance type like t2micro, t2 medium, t2 large, t2 small 

=> Configure the Instance 

 You need to select vpc ,Subnet if you have there 
 
=> Add Storage 

=> Add Tags

=> Configure Secuerity Group 

 This is actually firewall 
 If you have your own firewall then you can select it otherwise if you want you can create your own secuerity group 
 
=> Review Launch Instance 

=> Select AWS Key pair and download it becauese you need to login the launched server 

=>So finally launched the server 

=====================================================================================

*** How to launch the windows server

This server also able launch aabove steps but after launching the windows server you need to create username password 

Go to => Actions -> under select the -> create password for windows server option 

After creating password it will show username and password for windows server 

=>Go to Remote Desktop Connection give username password then you can able to login the server 

======================================================================================================

### How to change Instance resizing 

Example: If your t2.micro instance is too small for its workload, you can change it to an m3.medium instance 

=> If services are launched then you need to select server and stop that server

=> go to ->Actions ->Instance Setting->Change Instance type->Select Instance Type -> Save& Exit 

=> Now able to login and check weather instance type is changed or what 

=================================================================

### Can we change an EC2 instance from one region to another region ??

No It's not possible if you want you should take backup means "create an AMI instead of that server" and you can restore it 
into that particular region 

==================================================================
### How we can EC2 purchasing Option 

=> There are 3 EC2 purchasing options offered by AWS : On Demand, Reserved and spot instances 

================================================================

### What is EC2 Instance Metadata 

=>Used to configure or manage the running instance 

=> Includes metadata about the instance such as instance id, AMI id, hostname, IP Address, Role 

=>Can be accessed from "CURL http://ip/latest/meta-data/"

===========================================================================



### Module 2:

2) Storage Services and Aws Cli :
------------------------------
Volume vs vault 

Volume : It's a storage device, that is formatted to store directories and files for frequent use. e.g. fixed disk, CD-ROM etc.

vault: A storage box or a container which stores the archive data for longer period of time 


## What is cloud storage 

A cloud storage is a service model in which data is 

 maintained
 managed
 backedup remotely 
 made available to users over a network 
 
users pay for their cloud data storage on either 
  
 pay per use 
 monthly rate 

There are 2 types of storage between in AWS 

1) Block Storage 

2) Object Storage (S3, Glacier) 

1)Block Storage : A block storage is known as Elastic block Storage 

2) Object Storage: object storage is known as S3 (simple storage service) 

Glacier : glacier has long term archibale solution  


So EBS comes under "Tier 0 nd Tier 1" High performing and high cost 

S3 comes under "Tier 2" It's also high performing but it's not a block storage we can't use that one to install 
the updating system applications database we can only store or files on it 

"Tier 3" This is actually slow storage in cloud if i compare that how quickly even to read file format 


### AWS Connecting Storage 

Data can be transferred through internet also but it will be slow and cost 

1) Storage gateway : Integrates on premises IT environments with AWS storage (storage transfer limit=32 TB )

2) snow ball : A service that enables large-volume data transfer storage limit=80 TB

 

### Common Terms 

=> Disk 

SSD (Solid state Drive) A storage device containing non-volatile flash memory, used in place of a hard disk because of its 
much greater speed 


=> Performance 

IOPS (I/O Operation Per Second)  I/O Means input output operations per second like computer storage devices HDD, SSD etc..

Disk I/O : It displays what percentage of time a disk is in use by a readf or write command 


=> MEMORY

  -> TiB (Tebibyte): 1 TiB = 1.10 TB = 1024 Gigabytes, 1 Terabyte= 1000 Gigabyte 
  
  -> GiB (Gigibyte): 1 GiB= 1.07 GB =1024 Mebibytes, 1 Gigabyte=1000 Megabyte 
  
  -> MiB (Megibyte): 1 Mib= 1.05 MB = 1024 Kibibytes, 1 Megabyte=1000 Kilobyte 
  
  
### EBS (Elastic Block Storage) 

=>Provides block level storage volumes for EC2 instances 

=> When to use it 

 -> Data Changes Frequently 
 -> Require long term persistence 
 -> Database style applications that frequently encounter many random reads and writes across the data set 


EBS VOLUME & Snapshot
----------------------
-> Primary storage for data that requires frequent updates or storage for a database applications

-> EBS Snapshot

  -> can backup the data on the ebs volumes to amazon s3 by taking point in time snapshot 
  -> Snapshots are incremental backups 
  -> Snapshots are encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted 
  -> volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted 

LAB

  -> create Volume instead of the created server

  -> Go to EBS -> Volume->Select Volume Option 
 
  -> Create volume and there give Availability Zone name for that created server Zone and create it 

  -> After you have to attach the volume to that server 


=================================================================

### Add the Storage disk on server 
--------------------------------

=> lsblk  

Create volume in AWS 

=> Go to EBS -> volumes -> Create Volume -> Select Zone, Disk Size, save it

=> Then you need to attach it to the particular server

Volumes -> Actions -> Attach Volume -> select server name and save it 

=> Go to linux command prompt check there "lsblk"

=> After we need to create file system "ext" and making it mount on to that server device 

=>  mkfs -t ext3 /dev/xvdb
