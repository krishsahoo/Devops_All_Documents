Step1: Schedule the jobs by 2 types 

    1 Timer
	2 Poll SCM
	
Step2: Go to Job Config menu 

Step3: Under SCM Select Git hub URl given there

Step4: Go to build triggers There select " Build periodically"

Step5: Minute Hour DOM Month DOW

       Minute- Minutes within the hour(0-59)
       Hour - The hour of the day (0-23)
       DOM - The day of the Month (1-31)
       The Month (1-12)
       Day of the week (0-7) Where 0 and 7 are sunday.

      */2 * * * * - This is timer setup every 2 mins trigger the job automatically

After that again go to the job => under config menu

Go to build triggers =>select Poll SCM => */2 * * * * - This is also every 2 mins trigger the job automatically


it seems there are 2 ways like Build periodically, Poll SCM

Diff B/W Build periodically and Poll SCM:

Build periodically means - Schedule the Cron tab job and every 2 mints trigger the job automatically

Poll SCM means- Scheduled the Cron tab job and any developers commit the changes in git hub then only the job will be triggering other wise it won't get trigger
