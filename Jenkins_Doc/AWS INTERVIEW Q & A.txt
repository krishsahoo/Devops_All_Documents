VPC Services 
------------

 
 
 
1)  What is VPC?
-----------------
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It allows to customize your networking configuration.  It is a network which
is logically isolated from another network in the cloud. It allows you to have your IP address range,  
internet gateways,subnet and security groups.

2) What is the use of VPC in AWS?
----------------------------------
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've 
defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center,
with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

3) How do I connect to AWS VPC?
---------------------------------
Create a customer gateway. Open the Amazon VPC console. ...
Create a virtual private gateway. In the VPC console, under VPN Connections, choose Virtual Private Gateways. ...
Create a VPN connection. ...
Get the VPN connection configuration and configure your customer gateway.

==============================================================================

1) what is subnet 
--------------------
A public subnet is a subnet that's associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway. 
A private subnet with a size /24 IPv4 CIDR block (example: 10.0. 1.0/24). ... An Internet gateway. 
This connects the VPC to the Internet and to other AWS services.

2) What is the use of subnet in AWS?
------------------------------------
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.


============================================================

=> Storage services


1) Explain what S3 is?
-----------------------

S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. You can use S3 interface to store and retrieve any amount of data, 
at any time and from anywhere on the web

 -----------------------------------------

S3 is a REST service, and you can send a request by using the REST API or the AWS SDK wrapper libraries 
that wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API.

3)Explain default storage class in S3
-----------------------------------

The default storage class is a Standard frequently accessed.


 
4) What are the storage class available in Amazon s3?
-----------------------------------------------
Amazon S3 standard
Amazon S3 standard-infrequent Access
Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
Amazon Glacier

6) How many buckets can you create in AWS by default?
--------------------------------------

By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts.

===========================================================================

1)what is ebs??

ebs stands for Elastic Block Store is an easy to use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use 
with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale.


1)What is AWS EBS used for?
----------------------------------
AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is Amazon's block-level storage solution used with the EC2 cloud service to store persistent data
This means that the data is kept on the AWS EBS servers even when the EC2 instances are shut down.

2) What is the difference between s3 and EBS?
--------------------------------------------------
EBS delivers high-availability block-level storage volumes for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.
Finally, Amazon S3 is an object store good at storing vast numbers of backups or user files. Unlike EBS or EFS, 
S3 is not limited to EC2.


3)What are the types of EBS?
--------------------------------
The three types  
1)throughput optimized  HDD (st1)
2)Provisioned IOPS (SSD) 
3)General Purpose (SSD) EBS volumes.
All three have their merits and offer similar functionalities, such as snapshot capabilities, 
though they differ largely in cost and performance.

==================================================================

1) What is volume  
----------------------
An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to one instance or to 
multiple instances at the same time. You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires 
frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.

2)What is volume snapshot in AWS?
-----------------------------------
An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your Amazon EBS volume, which is lazily copied to Amazon Simple 
Storage Service (Amazon S3). EBS snapshots are incremental copies of data. This means that only unique blocks 
of EBS volume data that have changed since the last EBS snapshot are stored in the next EBS snapshot

==================================================================================

1) What is snapshot in AWS ec2?
----------------------------------
One of the methods that Amazon Web Services (AWS) recommends for protecting Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances 
is the creation of snapshots.Instead, a snapshot is a copy of the storage blocks that have been modified since 
the previous snapshot was created

2) What is the difference between image and snapshot in AWS?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A snapshot is a backup copy of any EBS volume, and is saved in S3 storage. An Amazon Machine Image is a snapshot 
of an EBS volume with an Operating System on it. ... At launch time, the EBS volumes of the new instance are 
copies of those snapshots and mapped to the instance as defined by the AMI.

=====================================================================================

1)What is AMI?
----------------
AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image.  It’s a template that provides the information 
(an operating system, an application server, and applications) required to launch an instance, 
which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud.  
You can launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need.

2) Mention what the relationship between an instance and AMI is?
------------------------------------------------------------
From a single AMI, you can launch multiple types of instances.  An instance type defines the hardware of the host 
computer used for your instance. Each instance type provides different computer and memory capabilities.  Once you 
launch an instance, it looks like a traditional host, and we can interact with it as we would with any computer.

3) What does an AMI include?
-------------------------------
A template for the root volume for the instance
Launch permissions decide which AWS accounts can avail the AMI to launch instances
A block device mapping that determines the volumes to attach to the instance when it is launched

==============================================================================================


=============================================================

1) What is security group? 
---------------------------------
Security groups are used to collect user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units. 
In the Windows Server operating system, there are several built-in accounts and security groups 
that are preconfigured with the appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific tasks

2) How does a security group work?
------------------------------------
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
For each security group, you add rules that control the inbound traffic to instances, and a separate set of 
rules that control the outbound traffic.


3) What is inbound and outbound in security group
-----------------------------------------------
For example, an inbound rule might allow traffic from a single IP address to access the instance, 
while an outbound rule might allow all traffic to leave the instance. Because security groups function at the 
instance level of a VPC, each security group can be applied to one or more instances, even across subnets

==================================================================================================

1) What is IAM role in AWS?
---------------------------
An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.
You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access 
to your AWS resources.

2) How do I use IAM in AWS?
----------------------------
Getting Set Up.
Creating an IAM Admin User and Group. Creating a Delegated User. ...
Delegate Access to the Billing Console. Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using Roles. ...
Best Practices and Use Cases. Business Use Cases.
IAM Console and Sign-in Page. ...
Identities. ...
Access Management. ...
Access Analyzer.

3) What does IAM mean?
------------------------
An acronym for Identity and Access Management, IAM refers to a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring 
that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources. Also called identity 
management (IdM), IAM systems fall under the overarching umbrella of IT security.

==========================================================================

1)What is AWS Route 53 used for?
---------------------------------
Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances, 
Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure 
outside of AWS

2) How does AWS Route 53 work?
-------------------------------
Amazon Route 53 is a web service which is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) 
It is a Domain Name System (DNS) which translates domain names into IP addresses to direct traffic to your website. 

=============================================================================
1) What is role 
-----------------
An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions 
You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access 
to your AWS resources.


2) What is role and policy in AWS?
-------------------------------------
You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) 
or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines 
their permissions.

=====================================================================================================

1) What is load balancing 
-------------------------
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as 
Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your 
application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zone

2) What is the use of load balancer in AWS?
----------------------------------------------
A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming 
application trafficacross multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. 
This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.

3) What are the types of load balancing?
-----------------------------------------
Load Balancer Types. Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load 
Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. Amazon ECS services can use either type of load 
balancer.Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic.
