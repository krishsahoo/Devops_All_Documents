1. AWK Operations:

awk is a oriented toward delimitied fields on a per line basis.

(a) Scans a file line by line
(b) Splits each input line into fields
(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern
(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines

2. Useful For:
(a) Transform data files
(b) Produce formatted reports

3. Programming Constructs:
(a) Format output lines
(b) Arithmetic and string operations
(c) Conditionals and loops


Sample Commands

cat > employee.txt   (create a .txt file)

ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
tarun peon sales 15000
deepak clerk sales 23000

 awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt 
 
 
 3. Spliting a Line Into Fields    (f the line has 4 words, it will be stored in $1, $2, $3 and $4 respectively. 
 Also, $0 represents the whole line.)
 
  awk '{print $1,$4}' employee

  
4.awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt ::Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number 


  
  
  Use of NF built-in variables (Display Last Field)  nf means number of field
  
5.awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt 
   
   
   
Another use of NR built-in variables (Display Line From 3 to 6)

 awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt

3) To print any non empty line if present

awk 'NF > 0' geeksforgeeks.txt


4) To find the length of the longest line present in the file

awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) } END { print max }' geeksforgeeks.txt


5) To count the lines in a file

 awk 'END { print NR }' geeksforgeeks.txt


6) Printing lines with more than 10 characters

 awk 'length($0) > 10' geeksforgeeks.txt
