Linux & Shell Script 
=======================

Linux Architecture :
-------------------

Shell & system daemons =>

The shell is the command interpretor in an operating system such as Unix or GNU/Linux,
it is a program that executes other programs. It provides a computer user an interface to the Unix/GNU Linux system
so that the user can run different commands or utilities/tools with some input data.

-> program execution 
-> variable interpretation 
-> filename substitution
-> I/O redirection 
-> manage pipes 
-> when a user login an instance of shell program is created for her/him
-> interpreted programming language

Bourne shell - /bin/sh and /sbin/sh 

GNU bourne-again shell - /bin/bash 

c shell - /bin/csh 

korn shell  - /bin/ksh 


Kernel => kernel is the core of the linux OS and it is also called as hardware interface 

-> kernel has distinct pre-defined tasks to do and shell too has distinct predefined  tasks to do 
-> Manage memory,so that all programs and running processes can work.
-> manage cpu, which is used by running processes 
-> manage access and use of the different peripherals connected to the computer
-> manage file system 

Hardware

1)what is linux ??

linux is an os, it is based one the linux kernel and can run on diff hardware platforms.

------------------------------------------

2)diff bw linux and unix 

linux- linux is an open source software development and free os used for computer hardware,software,game development
pcs etc.. 

unix- unix is operating system which is basically used in intel,hp,internet servers,etc...

linux- linux has priced as well as freely distributed and downloaded versions.

unix- diff versions/flavours of unix have different price structures.

linux- file support system includes Ext2 ext3 Ext4  jfs,xfs,Btrfs,Fat,etc..

unix- file support system includes jfs,gpfs,hfs,etc...

linux exmp- Redhat,Fedora,ubuntu,debian,etc.

unix exmp- Solaris,all linux 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

3)why we use linux ??

linux is used widely because it is completely different from other operating systems where every aspects comes with 
something extra i.e some additional features.

------------------------------------------------------------
4)what is LILO ??

LILO is a boot loader for linux.it is used mainly to load the linux operating system into main memory 
so that it can begin it's operations.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5)what is swape space ??

swap space is a certain amount of space used by linux to temporarily hold some programs that are running concurently
this happens when RAM does not have enough memory to hold all programs that are executing.
